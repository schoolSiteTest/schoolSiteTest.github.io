                                            Born in Vitebsk, Belarus in 1930 to a father who joined the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917, Dr. Alferov studied physics at Leningrad after World War II, which claimed his older brother, Marx. Alferov did much of his groundbreaking research during the Cold War years. Since his father was an ardent Communist, he was named after the famous French socialist revolutionary, Jean Jaurès.</p>
